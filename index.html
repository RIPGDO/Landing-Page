    <h1>
      Hello there and welcome to the History about SM64(Super Mario 64)Speed
      runs
    </h1>

    <!--The-beginnning-for-SM64-speedruns-->

    <h2> The  beginnning of SM64 Speedruns </h2>
     <p> It all starts with the 70 stars Speedrun where player use different ways to beat the game as fast as possibe and 70 stars was the limit at the time. 
       That was until mid-2000s when some poeple where messing around in the game and they discroved the BLJ
     </p>
     <br>
     
       <img height="90" src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/OUuTRPxsoskAAAAd/sm64-blg.gif"> 
     <p>that was able to beat the infinte stair case for once then the number was lowered from 70 to 50, 50 was the max later in March 16th 2003 tgera2000 found out you could do the BLJ in the 50 stars door because there was a stair case near it even if it was small but more then enough to do thr BLJ and yet again the number was reduced to 31.</p>


     <!--Mips-the-dumb-rabbit-that-is-hard-to-catch-->
     <h2> MIPS</h2>
     <p> <a href="https://sm64-conspiracies.fandom.com/wiki/MIPS"> Mips </a> is a rabbit you can catch in the basment and spawns as soon as you have 15 stars and this little rabbit made a change in the speedrun.

      When You catch Mips you can get his star and move him where ever you want in the basment zone unless you get near the exit a-line yourself in a specfic spot Mario would cilp into the door?</p>
     <img height="90" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgdW-8caYAAsKsu.png">
      <p> In 2004 Dom Dunc found this and once Mario was in the door you could do two things to get Mips on the other side, one was crawling trowards Mips and pick him up then facing the other way was drop him hoping he clips out the door and onto the other side.</p>
      <p>The second way is clipping Mario in like in the first way gabbing Mips but instead of dropping him you can try to jump out the exit but this can cilp you back to the spot you were, so for beginners it's recommed to do the first way.  </p> 
      <p> With Mips clipping Mario through a door could mean he could no clip through anything right? will speedruns placed it to the test clipped though the 30 star door to get to Bowser the only thing in there way way Dire dire docks and from there they could get the star on Bowsers Sub and beat Bowser then the rest was the same for the speedrun, 1 BLJ on the 50 star Door and then the last BLJ on hte infint stair case and the halfed to 16 and 16 was the max for a good while.</p>
     
     
       <!--Zero-star-speedrun-->


      <h2> Breaking the limit to ZERO</h2>  
      <p> SM64 was already a glichly game that speedruns would use to beat the game but after finding the BLJ and MIPS and the limit was 16 stars as we know or so we thought back in 2009 a user by no name (yes that was his user) would the first person to break the game to it's limit by being the first person to do a ZERO STAR SPEEDRUN.</p>
      <p>A 0 star speed run is where the the BLJ is mostly used to skip the 8 star, 30 star and Dire dire docks.for the 8 star door you go to the basment and jumping into a small gap where Mario is stuck dude to inv walls that are over leaking ceilling and from there you can do the BLJ and no-clip outside the casle ans moves mario towards the 8 star door and no clip through it just like with the 50 star door you beat Bowser get the key and BLJ on the star case since your not able to leave unless you quit the leave btu with this BLJ you can no clip to the basment door and open it. </p>
      
      <p> next when you enter the basment there is a stair case to go down with enough aiming you can BLJ there and past the 30 star door without Mips but you run the chance to go into Dire dire docks or pass it mainly lucky and how you do the BLJ and hopfuly pass Dire dire docks and get to the second Bowser fight beating him takes you back and instead of going into the Bowser fight stage and exitting it you do it in Dire dire docks this time and then open the upstairs door noclip up the the stars and do the BLJ in the 50, and infinite star case and beat the game from there and the current world holder for the o star speedrun is <it class=""> GreenSuigi</it> with a record of 16:16.60. <wind class="">( I will update the current holder when there is a new one it will be a little late becuase i'm busy with life will try my best :] )</wind> </p>

      <!--the Shindou virson--->
      <h2> The break through </h2>
       <p> Almost one year later in Japan Nintendo relesed another version of SM64 called the Shindou virson that fixed some bugs here and there and one of them was the famous BLJ which broke the speedrun commity but lucky it was a diffent cartge and was only in Japan which means speedruns didn't even know it existed unilt Super Mario 3D AllStars but that didn't stop them from pushing the games to it's limits and to beat the game with the lowest possbile stars but nobody had a idea on how to do it. later with a TAS <game class="">( A tool-assisted speedrun or tool-assisted superplay (TAS tas) is generally defined as a speedrun or playthrough composed of precise inputs recorded with tools such as video game emulators) </game> <a href="https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/Hyperspeed_Wall_Kicks"> firsty </a> which are many wall kicks agaisnt a wall on the first frame possbile which use humans can't really do be lucky we have TAS ro show what would happen if we did Firstys and the we can gets this. </p>

      <p> This glich was just like the BLJ but harder to use that there is currently only TAS speedruns have been done on the Shindou virson and the number didn't go down slowly like in the orginal game it went from 70 stars to just 1 star yes another 69 stars skipped and the only one need was the one in Dire dire docks which was: Board Bowser's Sub. and so the max stars to need to beat the Shindou virson was 1 star and that's where it has stayed for sometime now. </p>
